start working on something else, and return to this issue when it is resolved by the Wakanda-team.

 This task would include setting up an development environment for the frontend. I have a framework that is built on Angular, Bootstrap and SASS. You can see it live here: http://iarouse.com/dist-flatify/v1.2/index.html#/dashboard I would like to use the styles of this project to build an app. Most of the stuff in the framework is not needed, only the basic CSS including the animations.

  In the setup task, you would take the styling of this project and create a skeleton application complete with build scripts. There are several changes that need to be made to the basic setup, so I think it would be easiest to start from scratch. Specifically, I would like to have the following libraries included, which are not a part of the Flatify-theme:
 - angular-translate: https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate
 - ui-router: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router
While you set this up, I will construct a basic page flow that we can then put in and start to build the complete app.
